# Einspline

Some of the files included in this QMCPACK einspline directory are based on the einspline library
released by Ken Esler http://einspline.sourceforge.net/ . einspline is a C library for the creation
and evaluation of interpolating cubic basis splines (B-splines) in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions.
